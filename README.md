Short decriptions for all of the projects that I have done: 

1. Flood It game: 
  + Program language: C++
  + Operating System: Windows
  + About the game: A grid of six colors of tiles starts off randomly. The player can do a "flood fill" on the top left tile, changing the color of any adjacent tiles of the same color. The player wins if they are able to make the entire board a single color within a certain number of moves.

2. Metronome:
  + Program language: C
  + Operating System: Windows
  + Hardware requirements: FRDM-KL25Z processor, Analog 2-axis Thumb Joystick with Select Button, Jump wires, Mini Electronic 5V Buzzer.
  + About the program: Creating a simple metronome, a device that produces an audible click or other sound at a regular interval that can be set by the user, typically in beats per minute (BPM). The sound is generated from the buzzer. User can control the BPM with predetermined values and frequencies (volume) of it via analog joystick.

3. TCP Server between Client:
  + Program language: C
  + Operating System: Linux
  + About the program: TCP server sending system time after call from client (request - message 80 char string with request “get time”, response – message 80 char string with formatted time) through a chosen port number established by Server.
